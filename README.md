# QR_Code
     In this project, we put the QR code on the bills for saving our times. Putting a QR code reader to the mobile banking application will help us paying our bills more easily and in a shorter time whenever we want. In that case, we will make the payment of the bills easier for the youths who already have technology in their lives. To make use of the QR code, we also thought about putting a software program of the QR code to the ATMs. In this process, the only thing what citizens have to do is to take their cards and bills with them. At the ATM, they just have to show the QR code on the bill to the QR code reader at the ATM so that they can pay. Thanks to this Project, we will solve the problems for the elderly people who have troubles in paying their bills and who wait in long cues at the banks, ATM.
     Our aim on this Project is making the process which takes our time and energy easier by adapting the QR ( Quick Response ) technology, which we met in 1994, with a more revolutionary design in todayâ€™s world.
